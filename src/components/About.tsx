                        I build the backend systems that can't afford to break. I started as an intern and, within
                        two years, grew into the lead engineer role - designing and shipping entire systems on my
                        own: identity and access management, billing and licensing engines, sensitive-data
                        classification, and cloud infrastructure. Owning systems end-to-end, alone, is what taught me
                        how they actually work underneath the abstractions.
                    </p>

                        I'm drawn to backend problems where correctness isn't negotiable - distributed architectures
                        where a single failure cascades, identity layers where a bug is a breach, and data pipelines
                        that have to stay consistent under load. That's why fintech is where I want to take this work
                        next: it demands exactly the things I care about most - reliability, security, and
                        financial-grade
                        correctness where "mostly right" simply isn't good enough.

                        Alongside writing code, I run Scrum for my team - sprint ceremonies, unblocking people,
                        keeping delivery on track - which reinforced that great engineering is as much about clear
                        communication as raw technical skill. Outside of work, I build and open-source tools,
                        including Helix, an AI-powered PR reviewer that cut our review time in half. I'm always
                        looking for harder systems problems to take on - ideally ones where money's on the line.
